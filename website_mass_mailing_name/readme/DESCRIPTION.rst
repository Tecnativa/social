This module extends the functionality of mass mailings to support asking for
the contact name directly in the subscription snippet.

If you want to get partners created automatically and linked to the contacts,
you can additionally install the `mass_mailing_partner
<https://www.odoo.com/apps/modules/12.0/mass_mailing_partner/>`_ module.
